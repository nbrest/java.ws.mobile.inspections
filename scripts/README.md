# My.Scripts:

This folder contains most of my shell scripts to automate some tasks setting up, building, deploying and debugging kamehouse.

Copy `my.scripts` folder to `${HOME}/my.scripts` and source `(win/lin)/bashrc/bashrc.sh` from `${HOME}/.bashrc` and then most scripts should work out of the box
