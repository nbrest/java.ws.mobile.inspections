# Shell Module:

This module contains most of my shell scripts to automate some tasks setting up, building, deploying and debugging kamehouse.

## Install

- The script `./scripts/install-kamehouse.sh` also installs kamehouse-shell

Or install manually by executing `kamehouse-shell-install.sh` from the root of the kamehouse git project
```sh
chmod a+x ./kamehouse-shell/bin/kamehouse/kamehouse-shell-install.sh
./kamehouse-shell/bin/kamehouse/kamehouse-shell-install.sh
```
