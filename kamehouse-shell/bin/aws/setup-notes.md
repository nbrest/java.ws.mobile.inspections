Added ln -s /home/nbrest to /home/ubuntu for some scripts
Added ln -s /var/log/apache2 to /home/ubuntu/programs/apache-httpd/logs
Added ln -s /var/log/tomcat8 to /home/ubuntu/programs/apache-tomcat/logs
Added user ubuntu to tomcat8 group to have access to logs (still not enough though, need to sudo)
